Design:

1. main.ino     - contains the main loop, calls setups and updates of each component with dt. uses clock.
2. <component>  - has a method: int update(dt) that is being called every dt. (we can use internal count if tick is needed)
3. globals?


"Triggers"
when a component (lets say optic comm) completes a task (receive a msg) its update func will return a flag.
this will trigger an action (update boards layout).

Another example:
new entry in the mac_table was added / removed.

*** use empty namespace or static for a global in a specific file.



ADD A PREGAME OBJECT THAT HANDELS ALL PREGAME OPERATIONS (COMMS AND MATRIX)
ADD A START BUTTON CLASS (???????????)
